# Robo Advisor

The goal of the project was to create a Robo Advisor to help increasing their client portfolioâ€”especially by engaging young people. This application is focused in clients - existing and potential ones - who have the interest in learning about their recommended investment portfolio for retirement.

## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [DateTime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/) - This package provides a DateTime data type, as known from Zope.

Also, I used [AWS Lambda](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions) to develope the function and [AWS Lex](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/home?region=us-west-2#bots) to develpe the Chat Bot.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application it is *not* necessary to install the following dependencies since it is operated inside [AWS Lambda](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions) and [AWS Lex](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/home?region=us-west-2#bots).

* DateTime
```pip install DateTime```
